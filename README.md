iMAGEN is a React app that lets you search for images using the Unsplash API. It features a navigation bar and a search input that shows 10 images of whatever you search for. Please note that there is a limitation on the number of times you can search, which is 50 searches per hour.

## API Key

To use the Unsplash API, you need to provide an access key. You can get one by creating an account on the Unsplash website. Once you have your access key, implement in the api.js file.
